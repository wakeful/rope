* rope the selfish minimalistic container runner that just work
I always wanted a small tool for starting and stoping container(s) base on a config file [[file:.rope.yaml][.rope.yaml]]

* usagee
** example config file
config file contains section /services/ that is build from key value pairs - container image : replicas

#+begin_src yaml
services:
  nginx: 3
  ubuntu: 1
#+end_src

** build and run
#+begin_src shell
go build cmd/rope/rope.go

# docker engine needs to be installed and running
./rope.go -vvv -watch
#+end_src

[[file:example.gif][example run]]

* how this work
each time /rope/ starts a container we add a /label/ to it with the MD5 (maybe worth changing this) of the current working dir

** limitations
- no support for exposing ports and external volumes - this tool was build in mind of headless workers
- container discover needs to be done via external tools like /consul/ or /etc.d/ (an example with e2e test would be useful)
- one instance of /rope/ can monitor and mng only containers descriibe in the local /.rope.yaml/ file
- docker is required (we should add more runtimes support)

* ToDo [0/6] [0%]
- [ ] add a file watch to remove the need of restarting the watch process
- [ ] add config example generator
- [ ] add more e2e tests
- [ ] support other runtimes
- [ ] add CI/CD for release
- [ ] add code quality tooling
